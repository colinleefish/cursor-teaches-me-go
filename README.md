# CURSOR TEACHES ME GO üêπ

Welcome to your comprehensive Go learning journey! This roadmap is designed specifically for Python developers transitioning to Go. We'll build on your Python knowledge while introducing Go's unique concepts and paradigms.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of this roadmap, you'll be able to:
- Write idiomatic Go code with confidence
- Understand Go's concurrency model and goroutines
- Build web services and APIs
- Work with Go's type system and interfaces
- Deploy Go applications effectively

## üìö Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal: Understand Go syntax and basic concepts**

#### 1.1 Go Basics & Setup
- [ ] Install Go and set up your development environment
- [ ] Understand Go workspace and modules (`go.mod`)
- [ ] Write your first "Hello, World!" program
- [ ] Learn about `gofmt`, `go run`, `go build`

#### 1.2 Variables, Types & Basic Syntax
- [ ] Variable declarations (`var`, `:=`)
- [ ] Basic types: `int`, `float64`, `string`, `bool`
- [ ] Arrays vs Slices (major difference from Python lists)
- [ ] Maps (similar to Python dictionaries)
- [ ] String manipulation and formatting

#### 1.3 Control Flow
- [ ] `if/else` statements (no parentheses needed!)
- [ ] `for` loops (the only loop in Go)
- [ ] `switch` statements
- [ ] `defer` keyword (cleanup mechanism)

**Python vs Go Comparison:**
```python
# Python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_dict = {"key": "value"}

# Go
mySlice := []int{1, 2, 3}
myMap := map[string]string{"key": "value"}
```

### Phase 2: Functions & Error Handling (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal: Master Go's approach to functions and error handling**

#### 2.1 Functions
- [ ] Function syntax and multiple return values
- [ ] Named returns
- [ ] Variadic functions
- [ ] Anonymous functions and closures
- [ ] Methods vs functions

#### 2.2 Error Handling
- [ ] Go's explicit error handling (no exceptions!)
- [ ] The `error` interface
- [ ] Creating custom errors
- [ ] Error wrapping and unwrapping (`fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Unwrap`)

**Python vs Go Error Handling:**
```python
# Python
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Go
result, err := riskyOperation()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Error: %v\n", err)
}
```

### Phase 3: Structs & Interfaces (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal: Understand Go's type system and object-oriented concepts**

#### 3.1 Structs
- [ ] Struct definition and instantiation
- [ ] Struct methods and receivers
- [ ] Pointer receivers vs value receivers
- [ ] Struct embedding (composition over inheritance)

#### 3.2 Interfaces
- [ ] Interface definition and implementation
- [ ] Empty interface (`interface{}`)
- [ ] Type assertions and type switches
- [ ] Common interfaces: `io.Reader`, `io.Writer`, `fmt.Stringer`

**Python vs Go OOP:**
```python
# Python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, I'm {self.name}"

# Go
type Person struct {
    Name string
}

func (p Person) Greet() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Hello, I'm %s", p.Name)
}
```

### Phase 4: Concurrency (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal: Master Go's concurrency model - its superpower!**

#### 4.1 Goroutines
- [ ] Understanding goroutines vs threads

#### 4.2 Channels
- [ ] Channel basics and syntax
- [ ] Buffered vs unbuffered channels
- [ ] Channel directions (send-only, receive-only)
- [ ] Select statements
- [ ] Channel patterns: fan-in, fan-out, pipeline

**Python vs Go Concurrency:**
```python
# Python (asyncio)
import asyncio

async def worker(name):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print(f"Worker {name} done")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(
        worker("1"),
        worker("2")
    )

# Go
func worker(name string, done chan bool) {
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    fmt.Printf("Worker %s done\n", name)
    done <- true
}

func main() {
    done := make(chan bool, 2)
    go worker("1", done)
    go worker("2", done)
    <-done
    <-done
}
```

### Phase 5: Standard Library & Packages (Weeks 9-10)
**Goal: Become proficient with Go's standard library**

#### 5.1 Essential Packages
