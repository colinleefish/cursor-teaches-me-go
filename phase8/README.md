# Phase 8: Production & Best Practices 🚀

Welcome to production-ready Go development! This final phase teaches you to organize, optimize, and deploy Go applications at scale. You'll learn industry best practices and advanced deployment strategies.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

### Week 15: Code Organization & Performance
- **Package design**: Organizing large Go projects
- **Dependency management**: Modules, versioning, private packages
- **Performance profiling**: CPU, memory, and goroutine profiling
- **Memory optimization**: Reducing allocations and GC pressure
- **Benchmark-driven development**: Optimization methodology

### Week 16: Deployment
- **Cross-compilation**: Building for different platforms
- **Docker containerization**: Creating efficient container images
- **Cloud deployment**: AWS, GCP, Azure deployment strategies
- **Monitoring**: Metrics, logging, and observability
- **Production practices**: Health checks, graceful shutdown, scaling

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this phase, you'll be able to:
- [ ] Organize large Go codebases effectively
