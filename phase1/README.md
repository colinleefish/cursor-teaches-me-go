# Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) 🚀

Welcome to Phase 1 of your Go learning journey! This phase is designed like Berkeley CS61A with structured exercises, quizzes, and tests.

## 📋 Phase 1 Overview

**Goal**: Master Go basics, syntax, and fundamental concepts coming from Python.

### Week 1: Setup & Basic Syntax
- **Day 1-3**: Go Basics & Setup (`week1/basics/`)
- **Day 4-7**: Variables, Types & Basic Syntax (`week1/variables-types/`)

### Week 2: Control Flow
- **Day 8-14**: Control Flow Structures (`week2/control-flow/`)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Phase 1, you should be able to:
- [ ] Set up Go development environment
- [ ] Write and run basic Go programs
- [ ] Use Go's type system confidently
- [ ] Implement control flow logic
- [ ] Understand Go's syntax differences from Python

## 📁 Directory Structure

```
phase1/
├── week1/
│   ├── basics/              # Go installation, hello world, basic commands
│   └── variables-types/     # Variables, types, basic operations
├── week2/
│   └── control-flow/        # if/else, loops, switch, defer
├── quizzes/                 # Interactive knowledge checks
├── tests/                   # Automated test suite
└── solutions/               # Reference solutions
```

## 🧪 How to Use This Phase

### 1. Work Through Each Week Sequentially
Start with `week1/basics/` and follow the README instructions in each folder.

### 2. Complete All Exercises
Each folder contains:
- `README.md` - Instructions and examples
- `exercises.go` - Practice problems
- `practice_*.go` - Additional practice files
- `main.go` - Starter code

### 3. Test Your Knowledge
- Take quizzes in `quizzes/` folder
- Run tests with `go test` to validate your solutions
- Compare with reference solutions when stuck

### 4. CS61A-Style Learning
- **Incremental**: Each exercise builds on the previous
- **Test-Driven**: Write code to pass tests
- **Conceptual**: Focus on understanding, not just syntax

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Go** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install go
   
   # Or download from https://golang.org/dl/
   ```

2. **Initialize the module**:
   ```bash
   cd phase1
   go mod init phase1-foundation
   ```

3. **Start with Week 1**:
   ```bash
   cd week1/basics
   cat README.md  # Read instructions
   ```
