# Phase 6: Web Development 🌐

Welcome to Go web development! This phase teaches you to build production-ready web applications and APIs using Go's powerful HTTP capabilities. You'll learn everything from basic servers to database integration.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

### Week 11: HTTP Server
- **HTTP fundamentals**: Handlers, multiplexers, middleware
- **Routing**: URL patterns, path parameters, query strings
- **Request/Response**: Parsing, validation, JSON APIs
- **Middleware**: Authentication, logging, CORS, rate limiting
- **Static files**: Serving assets, file uploads

### Week 12: Database Integration
- **Database/SQL**: Connection management, queries, transactions
- **Popular drivers**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- **CRUD operations**: Create, read, update, delete patterns
- **Connection pooling**: Performance and resource management
- **Migrations**: Schema management and versioning

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this phase, you'll be able to:
- [ ] Build RESTful APIs with proper HTTP methods
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
- [ ] Handle file uploads and static content
- [ ] Design and implement middleware chains
- [ ] Connect to databases and perform operations
- [ ] Manage database connections and transactions
- [ ] Build complete web applications
- [ ] Deploy web services to production

## 🌐 Web Development Philosophy

**Go's Approach to Web Development:**
- **Standard library first**: `net/http` provides solid foundations
- **Explicit over implicit**: Clear request/response handling
- **Composition**: Build complex servers from simple components
- **Performance**: High-throughput, low-latency by default
- **Simplicity**: Avoid over-engineering and magic

## 🔗 What's Next

After mastering web development, you'll advance to **Phase 7: Advanced Topics** covering testing, benchmarking, reflection, and Go's newest features!

Ready to build the web with Go! 🌐🚀🐹
