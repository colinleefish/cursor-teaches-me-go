// TUTOR: Channels are Go's way of letting goroutines communicate safely.
// Think of channels as typed pipes - you put data in one end, get it out the other.
// Unlike shared memory, channels prevent race conditions by design.
// The key insight: "Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating."
// Channels turn concurrent programming from error-prone to elegant and safe.

	go func() {
		ch <- "Hello"
	}()

	msg := <-ch
	fmt.Println(msg)
}

// TUTOR: Channels are blocking by default - this is crucial for synchronization.
// Send blocks until another goroutine receives; receive blocks until another sends.
// This blocking behavior creates natural synchronization points in your program.
// Blocking ensures that data handoff is synchronized and safe.
// Understanding blocking behavior is key to designing correct concurrent programs.

// TUTOR: Channels enable safe data passing between goroutines without race conditions.
// Each value sent through a channel is received by exactly one receiver.
// This prevents the data races you'd get with shared variables.
// Channel communication is the foundation of safe concurrent programming in Go.
// Data flows through channels like water through pipes - clean and predictable.
// TODO: Demonstrate safe data passing through channels

}

// TUTOR: Channel closing signals "no more values" to receivers.
// Close with close(ch) - only the sender should close channels.
// Receiving from a closed channel returns the zero value and false.
// Closing enables clean termination patterns in concurrent programs.

// TUTOR: Range loops over channels receive all values until the channel is closed.
// The range automatically handles the receive and checks for channel closure.
// This is the most elegant way to consume all values from a channel.
// Range loops eliminate the need for manual closure checking in most cases.
// This pattern is essential for producer-consumer relationships.
// TODO: Demonstrate range loops over channels

			ch <- i
		}

		fmt.Println(value)
	}
}

// TUTOR: Channels coordinate goroutines naturally through their blocking behavior.
// Send/receive operations create synchronization points without explicit locks.
// This coordination is more intuitive than mutex-based approaches.
// Channel coordination scales well and composes nicely.
// Understanding coordination through channels is fundamental to Go's concurrency model.
// TODO: Demonstrate goroutine coordination using channels

// TUTOR: Channels have types - you can only send/receive values of the channel's type.
// Type safety prevents many concurrent programming errors at compile time.
// Different types need different channels - Go won't convert automatically.
// Channel types make concurrent programs more reliable and easier to understand.
// Type safety in channels extends Go's type safety to concurrent programming.

/*
ðŸ“¡ Channel Foundation Concepts:

1. **Purpose**: Safe communication between goroutines
2. **Creation**: make(chan Type) creates a typed channel
3. **Operations**: ch <- value (send), value := <-ch (receive)
4. **Blocking**: Send/receive block until counterpart is ready
5. **Closing**: close(ch) signals no more values
6. **Range**: for value := range ch receives until closed

ðŸŽ¯ Essential Patterns:
```go
// Basic communication
ch := make(chan string)
go func() {
    ch <- "Hello"    // Send
}()
msg := <-ch         // Receive

// Producer-Consumer
go func() {
    defer close(ch)  // Always close when done sending
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        ch <- fmt.Sprintf("Item %d", i)
    }
}()
for item := range ch {  // Receive all items
    fmt.Println(item)
}
```

ðŸš¨ Common Beginner Mistakes:
- Forgetting that channels block (causes deadlocks)
- Not closing channels (range loops never exit)
- Closing channels from receiver side (should be sender)
- Using nil channels accidentally (blocks forever)
- Trying to send/receive on closed channels

ðŸ”— What's Next:
Channels enable communication, but what if you need to handle multiple channels?
Next, learn select statements for advanced channel control!
