# Go Concurrency Mastery 🚀

Welcome to the complete guide to Go's concurrency model! This curriculum treats concurrency as a unified topic built on **4 fundamental cornerstones** that combine to create powerful concurrent systems.

## 🏗️ The 4 Cornerstones

Go's entire concurrency model is built on these foundational primitives:

1. **Goroutines** - Lightweight concurrent execution units
2. **WaitGroups** - Coordination and synchronization mechanisms
3. **Channels** - Communication highways between goroutines
4. **Select** - Non-blocking and multiplexed channel operations

Everything else is composed patterns using these 4 building blocks.

## 📚 Knowledge Hierarchy

This curriculum follows a strict dependency order - each level builds on the previous ones:

## 🚀 Why This Approach Works

### Traditional Problems:

- Learning goroutines and channels separately
- No clear progression from basics to advanced
- Patterns taught in isolation without foundations
- Missing the "big picture" of how everything connects

### Our Solution:

- **Unified Foundation**: Treat all 4 cornerstones as equally important
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each level builds on previous knowledge
- **Pattern Composition**: Show how cornerstones combine into patterns
- **Practical Focus**: Every concept immediately applicable

## 💡 Key Insights

### The Golden Rules:

1. **Goroutines** provide concurrency - use them liberally
2. **WaitGroups** provide coordination - use for synchronization
3. **Channels** provide communication - use for data flow
4. **Select** provides choice - use for control flow

### Pattern Selection Guide:

- **Need coordination?** → Start with WaitGroups
- **Need communication?** → Start with Channels
- **Need choice/timeout?** → Add Select
- **Need distribution?** → Combine with Goroutines

### Composition Strategy:

- Start with 1-2 cornerstones for simple patterns
- Add complexity by combining more cornerstones
- Layer patterns on top of each other for sophisticated systems
