# Phase 7: Advanced Topics 🧠

Welcome to advanced Go programming! This phase covers sophisticated topics that distinguish expert Go developers: comprehensive testing, benchmarking, reflection, and Go's latest features including generics.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

### Week 13: Testing
- **Unit testing**: Writing effective tests with `testing` package
- **Table-driven tests**: Comprehensive test coverage patterns
- **Benchmarking**: Performance measurement and optimization
- **Test coverage**: Measuring and improving code coverage
- **Mocking**: Test doubles and dependency injection

### Week 14: Advanced Concurrency & Reflection
- **Race detection**: Finding and fixing concurrency bugs
- **Advanced synchronization**: Mutex, RWMutex, atomic operations
- **Reflection**: Runtime type inspection and manipulation
- **Generics**: Type parameters and constraints (Go 1.18+)
- **Memory management**: Understanding Go's garbage collector

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this phase, you'll be able to:
- [ ] Write comprehensive test suites with high coverage
- [ ] Benchmark and profile Go applications
- [ ] Use reflection for dynamic programming
- [ ] Apply generics for type-safe, reusable code
- [ ] Debug complex concurrency issues
- [ ] Optimize memory usage and GC performance
- [ ] Understand Go's runtime and internals
- [ ] Apply advanced Go patterns and idioms
